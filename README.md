# MaxHeapProject
This project is my first "self-project" where I built a program from the ground up. The purpose of the program is to utilize and understand the logic of a Max-Heap so that I can use it in other projects. A Max-Heap is a way to save a data set so that the parent node is always larger than its children node and the largest data set is always at the top of the heap. The project consists of two classes: the Heap class maintains the heap logic and "swaps" the data nodes so the largest element is at the top of the array, while the MainClass manages the user inputs/outputs. 

Since this was my first project I built from the ground up, I included my drawio file that has my notes on a heap structure, use case diagram, object model, sequence diagram, and main/void/vr method flowchart to show how I arrived at the end result of my flowchart. In my sequence diagram, I ended up simplifying the program by combining the Array class into the Heap class when I decided against saving the array as an individual text file, but the logic is still the same, so I left it in. I hope the diagrams can help someone else that is working through a project of their own! 

Thanks for reading! I love to hear feedback and am constantly learning, so let me know if you liked the project or have any ways to improve it!
